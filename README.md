# Smart-Attendance-System.
A QR Code based Smart Attendance System built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Admin can log in, generate unique QR codes for students, and mark attendance using a web-based QR scanner. Attendance is stored securely in the database and can be viewed through an admin dashboard, reducing manual work and proxy attendance.
